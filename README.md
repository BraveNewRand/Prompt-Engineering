This is a Prompt Engineering Guide:
This guide aims to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of prompt engineering and how to design prompts that maximize the performance of Language Models (LLMs).

What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering involves crafting input instructions, often referred to as "prompts," that guide LLMs to produce desired outputs. Effective prompts are carefully designed to elicit contextually relevant and accurate responses from the model. Prompt engineering is a powerful technique for tailoring LLMs to specific tasks. By following best practices and experimenting with different prompts, you can achieve impressive results across a variety of NLP tasks.

Remember that prompt engineering is both a science and an art, so feel free to adapt and innovate based on your unique needs and goals.

Best Practices
Be Clear and Specific: Clearly state the task and provide context in the prompt. Avoid ambiguity that might confuse the model.

Use Placeholder Tokens: Use placeholder tokens like {text} or {input} to indicate where input should be placed in the prompt.

Task Descriptions: Describe the task clearly in the prompt. If relevant, specify the format or details expected in the response.

Provide Examples: Include example prompts to help the model understand the desired format and context.

Length and Complexity: Adjust prompt length and complexity based on the target task and model's capabilities.

Fine-tuning: Experiment with fine-tuning prompts to optimize results for specific tasks and datasets.

Avoid Bias: Be mindful of potential biases in prompts that might influence the model's output.


Experimentation:
Iterative Process: Prompt engineering often requires iteration. Experiment with different prompts to find the most effective ones.

Evaluate Results: Measure the model's performance using relevant metrics to identify successful prompts.
