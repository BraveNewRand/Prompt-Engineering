Here's an example of an iterative prompt development. This example involves using a language model to generate creative story ideas. Anyone can adapt this concept for different tasks and models:

Project: Creative Story Idea Generator

Iteration 1: Initial Prompt
# Initial prompt: "Generate a creative story idea involving time travel and a mysterious artifact."
response = generate_story_idea(prompt)
print(response)


Iteration 2: Adjusting for Clarity
# Refined prompt: "Imagine a story where a character discovers an ancient pocket watch that allows them to travel through time. Write a brief summary of this adventure."
response = generate_story_idea(prompt)
print(response)


Iteration 3: Adding Context
# Refined prompt: "Write a short story about a historian who stumbles upon a mysterious pocket watch at an archaeological site. As they use the watch to travel through time, they uncover secrets that could reshape history."
response = generate_story_idea(prompt)
print(response)


Iteration 4: Focusing on Themes
# Refined prompt: "Craft a story set in a dystopian future where a rebel leader finds a time-traveling artifact. The artifact can alter events in the past, but at a great cost. Explore themes of sacrifice and the consequences of tampering with history."
response = generate_story_idea(prompt)
print(response)


Iteration 5: Incorporating Feedback
# Refined prompt: "Write a science fiction tale about an inventor who invents a device that lets people travel to different points in their own lives. However, using the device comes with a trade-off â€“ the traveler loses a memory every time they jump. Explore the emotional impact on relationships and personal growth."
response = generate_story_idea(prompt)
print(response)
